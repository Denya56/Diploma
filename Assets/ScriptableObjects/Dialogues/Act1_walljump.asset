    _line: So... How am I supposed to get up there?
  - _actor: {fileID: 11400000, guid: e251fd8280ce7724d8deba7517d9c2a0, type: 2}
    _line: It's time to wall-jump.
  - _actor: {fileID: 11400000, guid: bfe4c5334aff16f479ab373fb42a8483, type: 2}
    _line: Ah... yes, perfectly fine thing to do for an engineer.
  - _actor: {fileID: 11400000, guid: e251fd8280ce7724d8deba7517d9c2a0, type: 2}
    _line: Agreed.
  - _actor: {fileID: 11400000, guid: bfe4c5334aff16f479ab373fb42a8483, type: 2}
    _line: Ok, let's do it... How do I do it?
  - _actor: {fileID: 11400000, guid: e251fd8280ce7724d8deba7517d9c2a0, type: 2}
    _line: You jump onto one wall then you keep holding onto the wall. Then you jump
      onto the other wall. Repeat the process. Jump onto one wall then jump onto
      the other and keep holding onto it.
  - _actor: {fileID: 11400000, guid: bfe4c5334aff16f479ab373fb42a8483, type: 2}
    _line: I jump onto one wall and then onto another and so on.
  - _actor: {fileID: 11400000, guid: e251fd8280ce7724d8deba7517d9c2a0, type: 2}
    _line: Great, maybe you are good after all.
  - _actor: {fileID: 11400000, guid: bfe4c5334aff16f479ab373fb42a8483, type: 2}
    _line: Thanks! Wait...
